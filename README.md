## Fractle.html 
* gennerates random fractle like patterns in canvas each time the page is refreashed (some are better than others)

## ElectronicLife
* Is a simulated world where plants and animals live
* The plants grow, the animals eat them and one eventually goes exstinct
* Future implementations:
  * Translate from cammandline to 2D or 3D world
  * Create better artificial intelligence models
  * Introduce carnivores
  * Possible game: 
    * player is a wolf that needs to herd herbivores and eat them
    * player must maintain the ecological ballance to keep game from ending
    * Stretch to learn AI: Player is member of wolf pack, the pack acts as unit responding to commands
